# Quiz Challenge

## Repository Description
A Monty Python-themed quiz game! This repo contains my quiz which was made almost entirely in JavaScript and tests your knowledge of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This repo will also save you score in localStorage and see how your score compares to others who take the quiz. If you find these questions to be hard (or, well, nonsense), do not blame me! Instead, blame the bridgekeeper!

## Challenge Reflection
This was my first project created entirely from scratch using JavaScript and I found this experience to be incredibly frustrating but equally as rewarding. Throughout this project I ran into problems with for loops, localStorage, JavaScript variables, timerIntervals, JSON stringify/parse, event listeners, and much more; however, with patience and leveraging the resources around me I was able to create a functioning quiz game. Going forward, I would like to expand on this quiz with additional yet-to-be-learned JavaScript techniques.
